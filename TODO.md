# TODO

+ Form validation (author, title, rating, date included)
+ Delete Books (delete reflected on db as well)
+ Set up login process - have traditional login with email + add google + fb (maybe twitter, github, etc)
+ Once login process setup, get user id working where only shows items where user id === current user id

+ General page when not logged in -> shows all recent entries (across all 3 options)
+ General page when logged in -> Shows all recent entries for current user
+ Once all that is working, implement for tv and movies.
+ Unit testing

QoL Improvements
======
+ Create microservice that gets cover/image for each entry (maybe in Go???)
+ Create star system for ratings instead of number dropdown
